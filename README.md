# Data Structures

## Array
- An array is a container which is used to hold a fixed number of items. 
- The array will consist of an ** index ** and an ** element **.
- The ** index ** is where the position where the element exists in the array.
- Time Complexity: 
    - Access: `O(1)`
    - Search: `O(n)`
    - Insert: `O(n)`
    - Remove: `O(n)`

## Linked List

- A linked list is a sequence of links which contains items. 


## Stack
- A stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. 
- It is used to store elements and allows operations such as push (adding an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removing the top element from the stack).

## Queue
- A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- It is used to store elements and allows operations such as enqueue (adding an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (removing the front element from the queue).

## Tree
- A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes. 
- The top node of a tree is called the root node. A child of a node may have zero or more child nodes. 

## Graph
- A graph consists of a set of vertices and edges that connect them. 
- Graphs are used to represent networks and relationships between objects. 

## Heap
- A heap is used to implement priority queues.
- It is a complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its children. 
- It can be implemented in a max or min variation.
